# U3_UnitProject_Shaan

<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: Shaan</h1>
 
<strong>Interaction</strong>: Since I will be creating the offline dinosaur game for my unit 3 project, I will need interaction. I will use a kinect to track the height of the player's feet. If the player's feet reach above a certain point, then the dinosaur will react and jump as well.
 
<strong>Description</strong>: When you are offline and trying to connect to a page on Chrome, then you are able to play a dinosaur game. Spacebar to jump, and then dinosaur keeps moving right. As he moves right, the score on the top right increases accordingly, while there are cactii as obstacles. I will recreate this game without the spacebar to jump. Instead, I will use a kinect to track the player's movememnt, and then jump.
